# Pix2Pix Implementation in PyTorch

The Pix2Pix GAN is a general approach for image-to-image translation. It is based on the conditional generative adversarial network, where a target image is generated, conditional on a given input image. In this case, the Pix2Pix GAN changes the loss function so that the generated image is both plausible in the content of the target domain, and is a plausible translation of the input image.
